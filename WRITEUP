1. labelled imagees using Fiji
2. created masks using Fiji
3. performed:
	3.a computed for the pixel hue mode of the roi
	3.b computed for the second moment to get the angle of orientation
		3.b.1 cv2.moment computed until 3rd moment
		3.b.2 computed for angle of orientation using (0.5*(np.arctan((2*M["m11"])/(M["m20"]-M["m02"]))))*(180./np.pi)
		3.b.3 computed for the 2d rotation matrix 
		3.b.4 performed affine warp on the roi using the rotation matrix
		3.b.5 output is a new roi na aligned along the major orientation
